# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Gestão de Estágio application, covering unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests.

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on individual components and functions, ensuring they work as expected in isolation.

- **Location**: `test/` directory, mirroring the `lib/` structure
- **Frameworks**: `flutter_test`, `mockito`
- **Coverage**: Business logic, use cases, repositories, services

### Widget Tests

Widget tests verify the UI components and their interactions with BLoCs and other state management solutions.

- **Location**: `test/features/*/pages/*_test.dart`
- **Frameworks**: `flutter_test`, `mockito`, `bloc_test`
- **Coverage**: UI components, page rendering, user interactions

### Integration Tests

Integration tests ensure that multiple components work together correctly, including navigation and data flow.

- **Location**: `integration_test/` directory
- **Frameworks**: `integration_test`, `flutter_test`
- **Coverage**: End-to-end workflows, navigation, data persistence

## Test Structure

### Dependencies

All tests use mock implementations for external dependencies:
- `MockCacheService` for data persistence
- `MockSyncService` for synchronization
- `MockNotificationService` for notifications
- `MockConnectivityService` for network status

### Test Modules

Tests use a dedicated `TestAppModule` that provides mock implementations:
- Located in `test_config.dart`
- Automatically bound in test setup
- Ensures consistent dependency injection across tests

## Running Tests

### Unit and Widget Tests

```bash
flutter test
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
flutter test integration_test
```

### Specific Test Files

```bash
flutter test test/path/to/test_file.dart
```

## Best Practices

1. **Mock External Dependencies**: Always use mock implementations for services and repositories
2. **Use Test Modules**: Leverage `TestAppModule` for consistent dependency injection
3. **Test Realistic Scenarios**: Create test data that reflects real-world usage
4. **Handle Asynchronous Operations**: Use `pumpAndSettle()` and `await` for async operations
5. **Verify State Changes**: Check both UI updates and state transitions
6. **Test Error Conditions**: Ensure proper error handling and user feedback

## Common Issues and Solutions

### BLoC Provider Issues

**Problem**: `BlocProvider.of() called with a context that does not contain a Bloc of type X`

**Solution**: Ensure all required BLoCs are provided in the test widget tree:

```dart
MultiBlocProvider(
  providers: [
    BlocProvider<BlocType>.value(value: mockBloc),
    // Add all required BLoCs
  ],
  child: const WidgetUnderTest(),
)
```

### Navigation Issues

**Problem**: Navigation failures in tests

**Solution**: Use `Modular.bindModule()` and ensure proper route registration:

```dart
Modular.bindModule(TestAppModule());
// Perform navigation
await tester.pumpAndSettle();
```

### Data Persistence Issues

**Problem**: Tests failing due to data persistence state

**Solution**: Initialize mock services and clear state between tests:

```dart
testWidgets('test description', (tester) async {
  // Initialize services
  final cacheService = Modular.get<CacheService>();
  await cacheService.initialize();
  
  // Clear any existing data
  await cacheService.clearAll();
  
  // Run test
  // ...
});
```

## Test Coverage Goals

- Unit test coverage: 80%+
- Widget test coverage: 70%+
- Integration test coverage: 60%+

## Continuous Integration

All tests are run automatically in the CI pipeline:
1. On every pull request
2. Before merging to main branch
3. On scheduled builds

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Regular review of test failures
- Update tests when functionality changes
- Add new tests for new features
- Remove obsolete tests
- Monitor test execution time

This strategy ensures the application remains stable and reliable as new features are added and existing functionality is modified.
